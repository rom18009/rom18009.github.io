            <p class="introtext">Here are a few things that are a must if visiting Cozumel </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>The best beaches in Cozumel</h3>
                    <blockquote>"Cozumel is filled with beautiful beaches all around the island. If you have the chance
                        you should either rent a car, a jeep, or a scooter or hire a <a
                            href="http://cozumelcruiseexcursions.net/index.html">tour company</a> to take you around and
                        explore the best beaches on the island.

                        Majority of the best beaches in Cozumel can be found on the east side of the island.
                        Unfortunately, the only way to get there is by vehicle (preferably by jeep. That way you can
                        enjoy the fresh air blowing in your face). You will get some of the most amazing views of the
                        Caribbean. If you’re lucky then you’ll have beaches all to yourself. Especially on the other
                        side of the island if you end up making it to that side.

                        If you’re looking for white sand beaches then head on over to San Martin’s Beach. This is our
                        favorite beach and it is located where most tourists can’t go; on the east side. The beaches are
                        simply nicer and way less crowded then around San Miguel. So make sure if you rent a vehicle or
                        take a guided tour you end up at San Martin’s Beach. It’s the most beautiful beach in Cozumel
                        (in our opinion) if you’re looking for natural beauty mixed with a taste of paradise."

                    <h3>Tour the Mayan Ruins</h3>
                    <blockquote>"Discover the Mayan ruins of the Yucatan Peninsula, explore the mystique of the ancient
                        cities through the Mayan Ruins. As you'll discover they are treasures from a great civilization
                        that disappeared. Among the most popular you can visit are the most popular Chichen Itza, Coba,
                        Tulum, and Ek Balam, there are also smaller ruins site, some located directly in Cozumel. Every
                        visitor to Cozumel wants to visit the famous Mayan ruins at least once on their vacation, here's
                        your chance!
                        In Cozumel you can find the ancient ruins of San Gervasio, the largest site on Cozumel, you
                        won't need to travel, as it is located in the island. The most popular and larger sites are
                        located in the main land, and will require that you take a ferry ride."

                    <h3>Scuba diving</h3>
                    <blockquote>"If you’re looking for the best diving in Cozumel (scuba or snorkel) then Deep Blue
                        (diving + snorkeling company) is right downtown San Miguel. They will gladly have snorkelers and
                        scuba divers on the same boat which is super convenient. This way your family or group of
                        friends can still go together and everyone can enjoy whichever one they prefer.

                        Prices are reasonable for both, starting at around $60 USD and then up from there. You can
                        expect great visibility, an awesome variety of marine life, and some walls of coral. Cozumel has
                        its own protected <a href="https://deepbluecozumel.com/cozumel/cozumel-reefs">Marine
                            Park</a> so you’ll for sure have a great time exploring down under."
